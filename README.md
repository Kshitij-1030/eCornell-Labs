# eCornell Labs

This repository contains my lab submissions for the eCornell Machine Learning Certificate Program. Each Jupyter Notebook reflects a specific module in the course and demonstrates practical application of core ML concepts including:

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning with techniques like GridSearchCV
- Model performance comparison using metrics like RMSE and R²

Labs are structured to follow the end-to-end machine learning pipeline with clear documentation, visualizations, and code implementations using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
